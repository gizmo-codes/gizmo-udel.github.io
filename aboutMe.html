  <p>I drove cross country this summer to California! I know a lot of people in California so I made a trip over and stayed for about 1.5 months. They met me on my drive in <b>Denver</b> where we kept going west visiting all the national parks we could make time for. <br><br/>

  <br><br/>
	We hiked in <b>Arches National Park</b>, <b>Zion National Park</b>, <b>Grand Canyon National Park</b> and towards the end of my stay we finally visited <b>Yosemite National Park</b>. It's very hard to pick a favorite, I want to go back to each one besides Arches probably. While it was great to see once, it's very monochrome. The hikes were very difficult given we were all beginners, however, we did our fair share and gradually did longer/more difficult ones as the parks progressed.

  <ul>
			<li><b>Music</b></li>
			<p>I'm nearly always listening to music. I'm also learning to play the piano whenever I get free time which is nearly none at the moment sadly.</p>
			<li><b>Games</b></li>
			<p>I also enjoy PC gaming or occasionaly board games, which I also don't have a lot of time for at the moment! This was a nice way to stay in touch with people while I sat inside for a year and a half...</p>
			<li><b>Movies/TV Shows</b></li>
			<p>Largely TV shows. I for some reason am perfectly fine with binging a show for 7 hours but don't want to set aside the 1-2 hours for a movie.</p>
			<li><b>Fitness</b></li>
			<p>I miss going to the gym, I stopped when COVID started and it has never really felt safe so I never went back. One day... RIGHT?!...</p>
