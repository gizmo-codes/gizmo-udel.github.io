Required content on the website

Your website should contain several important sections/pages and elements:

1. Navigation Panel - Move previous, next, and course site links to a drop down menu item labeled “Class Links”. Then, decide what the rest of your users’ navigational experience should be.

2. Landing Page / Home Page - with information about you and what you might be interested in pursuing in terms of career opportunities after graduation.

3. Projects - Include a list of projects that highlight your skills and interests. Include supporting information like what you did, where the viewer can access the code or materials, and include images (if possible) showcasing the work. At a minimum this can be a few class or personal projects; these don’t necessarily need to be coding projects.

4. Resume - You should create a section to showcase a digital copy of your resume/CV and implement a download functionality for a pdf/word file. A viewer should be able to view your resume in some form and download it for later.

5. Implement a footer on your site. A footer is located at the bottom of the website and is used to display content that doesn’t often change. It might include links for easy access, like social media icons, contact information and so on.

6. Contact Details - Typically your email address, but it’s also a good idea to include buttons for the various professional social networking sites you are on e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub.

7. Keep a photo of yourself on the page.

8. Some personal elements; make it interesting if you’ve got someone’s attention.
 

Add Google Analytics

You should begin investigating who visits your page and with what kind of technology. Google Analytics can provide these kinds of valuable statistics about your visitors. You’ll learn the location of visitors and whether they’re arriving via Google searches or from referring websites. Start integrating by following the link: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en (Links to an external site.)

 

Validating your web page

** To get full credit, all your pages must validate with validator.w3.org (Links to an external site.) in “HTML5 (experimental)”. **

 

Other Requirements & Notes

1. Organize your files into appropriate folders e.g., css in “css” folder

2. While it may be tempting to write long free form JavaScript or overuse style attributes in HTML files, these elements should be used sparingly in favor of organized and commented JavaScript and CSS files, respectively.

3. Update your CSS to display reasonably well on both a desktop and mobile device; you should implement a responsive design (e.g., using proportions of the screen size versus specific pixel sizes) but may also use a specific mobile style-sheet as necessary.
