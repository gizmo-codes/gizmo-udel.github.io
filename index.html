  <p>Hi! My name is <b>Matthew Chandler (Matt)</b>, welcome to my personal web page! I am a (semi...) motivated student at UD. <br><br/>

	I am currently a senior attempting to graduate this semester but have unfortunately felt unwell recently so I have stayed home as I am supposed to. As a result I might be splitting this semester into two and graduationg in spring 2022, which is fine.</p>

  <ul>
			<li><b>UX/UI</b></li>
			<p>I have always been critical of user interfaces, how they're laid out, and how we're expected to navigate them. There is a lot of thought that goes into something as silly as the color of a button. (I have spent way more time on the CSS than the HTML..)</p>
			<li><b>Backend</b></li>
			<p>Backend coding is also enjoyable but I miss that instant gratification I get when working on the frontend and seeing my work/progress instantly.</p>
			<li><b>HTML/CSS/Javascript</b></li>
			<p>What I have done with HTML/CSS/Javascript has been enjoyable but I'm not sure I would want to code in these languages as a full time job. They are a great introduction to UX/UI though, and I have enjoyed it so far so we'll see.</p>
